          <p>
            A <strong>Canvas Print</strong>, also known as a <strong>stretched canvas</strong> or <strong>canvas art</strong>, 
            is the result of an image printed onto canvas which is stretched, or gallery-wrapped, onto a frame to be displayed.
          </p>
          <p>We at Canvas Printing offer a gallery of beautiful artwork, from recognized artists, for customers to purchase
            in a variety of prints and finishes. We also allow our users to upload their own images for printing and, if 
            they wish, to be shared with the community of visitors to our website.
